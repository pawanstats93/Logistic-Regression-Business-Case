# Logistic-Regression-Business-Case
Proactive Attrition Management

## Business Case Overview:
This case study requires the researcher to develop a model for predicting customer churn at "Cell2Cell," a fictitious wireless telecom company, and use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan for enticing would be churners to remain with Cell2Cell.

Data for the case are available in csv format. The data are a scaled down version of the full database generously donted by an anonymous wireless telephone company. There are still 71,047 customers in the database, and 75 potential predictors. Researcher can use whatever method they wish to develop their predictive model. Logistic regression is perphaps the most obviou choice and is adequate for the task.

## Expectations
Your task is to execute the 3-stage process for proactive churn management. Please answer the following questions:
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity. 
2. Describe your predictive churn model.
3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
4. Demostrate the predictive performance of the model.
5. What are the key factors that predict customer churn? Do these factors make sense?
